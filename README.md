I created a production build of my React project using: npm run build

I pushed all my project files to a GitHub repository.

I logged in to Vercel and clicked “New Project”.

I selected my GitHub repository from the list.

Vercel automatically detected it as a React project and applied the correct settings.

I clicked Deploy, and Vercel built and deployed my app automatically.

Once deployment finished, Vercel gave me a live URL of my portfolio.
